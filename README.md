# consecutive_ints_function_python
## Details:

This is a function `consecutive_ints()` that takes integers that can be arranged into a list of consecutive integers and returns them in a list in ascending order. If the integers cannot be arranged into a list of consecutive integers, it `raise`s a `ValueError` with the error message `"The inputs must be arrangeable in consecutive order."`. If the arguments are not integers, it `raise`s a `TypeError` with the error message `"The inputs must be  integers."`.
